I've read a couple of management books. However, the books that have had a greater impact on me, as a manager, happen to be ... parenting books. 

Don't get me wrong: I don't advocate for managing people as if they were kids. But coincidentally or not, there's a big overlap between dealing effectively with kids and dealing effectively with adults (especially in the workplace): showing empathy, active listening, develop autonomy, avoid being judgemental, how to praise and how to provide negative feedback, ... the list goes on.

I can highly recommend [How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/769016.How_to_Talk_So_Kids_Will_Listen_Listen_So_Kids_Will_Talk)
and [The Whole-Brain Child](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10353369-the-whole-brain-child). 

Strictly speaking about more traditional management books, I seem to enjoy negotiation and communication books like [Getting to Yes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes) and [Difficult Conversations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/774088.Difficult_Conversations). Also, coincidentally or not, you learn **a lot** about how to deal with kids in those books. In a hurry, [Re:work Guides](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/) from Google is also a very good resource (for e-reader users: an epub/pdf can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/daniperez/rework/releases)).
