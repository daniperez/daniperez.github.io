# What makes a team more productive than others?

Teams productivity is a subject that I find personally fascinating (e.g. ["Accept every offer"](/accept-every-offer/)).
Researchers have hypothesized and tested many factors:

- Age
- Tenure	
- Strong leadership
- IQ
- Team members sitting together
- Consensus-driven decision making
- Extroversion of team members
- Individual performances
- Team size
- ...

What Google found out [^nytimes-google] [^smarter-faster-better] [^rework] was that
nothing of that matters, or at least it is not significant. This research,
although not groundbreaking, is noteworthy as it originates from a big company
rather than an experimental setting. For instance, forty years ago, researcher Meredith
Belbin already observed that teams comprised of highly skilled individuals
might underperform compared to less skilled counterparts — a phenomenon she
named the _Apollo Syndrome_ [^apollo].

And then, what matters? They found one thing mattered more than the others:
*norms*. 

But before we see what norms are, a little digression. From my own experience,
norms don't develop within a team without certain _foundation_:
*structure*. Structure is, in my opinion, the necessary but not sufficient
ingredient that allows a group of individuals to discover what are the norms
that work for them. In this post I wanted to explain what is **structure** and
**norms**, and show that "structure plus norms" trump individual qualities and
can help growing a happier and more productive team.

# Structure

I firmly believe "structure" is not an aspirational or subjective need. It's
embedded in our brain. Our brain is a highly sophisticated engine. It also
consumes a lot of energy, especially because it's engaged in everything we do,
no matter how trivial. For example, if we enter a messy room, our brain can
feel overwhelmed. It won't make us immediately feel tired, sad or appalled but
it will take a toll on our concentration capacity (although it might boost
creativity). Conversely, a tidy room will make us feel better (although it can
also bore us or make us less creative).[^tidy] [^tidy2] Not only our brain craves
structure: the lack thereof can be detrimental to an organization.

If we are going to talk about structure, we need to talk about [Jo
Freeman](https://jofreeman.com/). She is a feminist activist and political
scientist with a long history of activism going back to the 60s. She wrote a
widely cited article called _The Tyranny of Structurelessness_[^tiranny].
Freeman recognized that oppression of women is not always limited to
interactions between men and women. She observed that a similar oppression was
happening, ironically, also _within_ her feminist circles or among groups
consisting entirely of women. She hypothesized that there must be other factors
that explained said oppression. 

For example, she observed that in her feminist circles, there were implicit,
unacknowledged and unaccountable structures, non-written rules, cargo cults and
non questioning the status quo. The lack of structure was fostering a
“tyranny”, to the detriment of the group and its goals. Ironically, again, this
oppression was originating from people striving to make a better world. Freeman
suggested that introducing more structure to those groups and submitting that
structure to a democratic control would make them more effective. However, she
also cautioned against swinging to the opposite extreme: adopting a rigid
structure.

Freeman also provides a few pointers about how to add structure to 
a group of people, for example:

{: .big-bullets}
1. _Submit authority in a group to the group._
1. _Avoid a person holding responsibilities for too long._
1. _Promote transparency and diffusion of information._

**(1) Submitting authority in a group to the group**, as Freeman explains, is
about distinguishing "authority" from "power" and give the power to the group,
delegate, and distributing also authority among as many people as possible.

**(2) Avoid a person holding responsibilities for too long**, it can allow
people to amass power. It's good to rotate positions and tasks. Follow
rational criteria to allocate tasks but consider people's preferences.

**(3) Promote transparency and diffusion of information.** Strive for equal
access to resources, including skills and information. Information is power,
and the farther it reaches, the more the power is distributed.

It's fascinating to observe the significant overlap between Jo Freeman's
observations from the 70s and the relatively recent findings by Google.

When I first learned[^meetup] about "The Tyranny of Structurelessness", it
really rang true to my experience. Not only regarding the structure of teams
but also the structure of work. Having regular and fixed _rituals_ (I hate that
name!), weekly 1-1s, participating in the planning of tasks, involving and
letting people decide most aspects of the functioning of the team, among other
things, have proven useful to me. In fact, I cannot claim those things are the
optimal way to lead a team, but I've observed that teams _without_ those
elements are awful to work in.

# Norms

As mentioned before, Google found out that teams with strong norms had
significant productivity gains:

> The researchers eventually concluded that the good teams had succeeded not
> because of innate qualities of team members, but because of how they treated
> one another. Put differently, the most successful teams had *norms* that
> caused everyone to mesh particularly well. 
>
> -- C. Duhigg, [Smarter, Faster, Better](https://www.charlesduhigg.com/smarter-faster-better/)

But let's hit the dictionary before we show what kind of norms were making
Google teams more productive:

> **Norm** (noun):
> Principle of right action binding upon the members of a group and
> serving to guide, control, or regulate proper and acceptable behavior.

Norms are guidelines, but not necessarily written ones. The important thing is
that they are accepted among the group and they are used by most of the people
most of the time. Good norms must bring a positive effect. Certainly, norms can
also be negative. For instance, if a leader often interrupts teammates during a
conversation, it establishes an “interruption norm”, which might discourage
people from speaking up. See also [^hbr-managers] [^mckinsey-managers].

When delving into their extensive data, the researchers discovered that not all
the norms were equal. Norms fostering **safety** and **accountability** had a
greater impact than the rest.

## Safety

In the previous example, a leader interrupted teammates frequently. That might
discourage people from speaking up. In other words, people will feel less _safe_
to express their opinions because the fear of being interrupted when doing so.
Norms that promote safety make the group a better place for taking risks and
grow diversity. Taking risks and embracing diversity —whether in terms of
people or opinion— is a key ingredient in innovation, and innovation will
benefit any group in a competitive setting.

Many norms around safety are about the following topics:

{: .big-bullets}
1. _Avoid embarrassment, rejection, or punishment for speaking up._
2. _Allow (encourage) mistakes._
3. _Increase interpersonal trust._
4. _Cultivate social sensitivity._

To encourage **(1) speaking up**, acknowledging your own fallibility (e.g.
stating you don't know something), especially from managers, will do wonders.
Being curious and a good listener, and allowing everyone to speak, will
encourage people to speak up. When people feel comfortable being themselves,
they also tend to express themselves more freely. That requires of a lot of
mutual respect and accepting the different.

**(2) Allowing mistakes** is easier if you admit your _own_ mistakes. If
something goes wrong, pointing to the causes and solutions instead of the
guilty person, will also make people feel more comfortable. Mistakes should be
seen as opportunities to learn and improve. 

If you let people speak up and allow them to make mistakes, you will **(3) increase
trust with each other**, avoiding ["the emperor has no
clothes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes)-kind of
situations. Fostering positive and negative feedback will also help there.

Google also found that very productive teams showed **(4) high social
sensitivity**, that is, people have empathy for each other, people worry about
each other. 

One skill worth learning, which touches upon many of the points above, is
_active listening_:

> Active listening is listening on purpose. Active listening is being fully
> engaged while another person is talking to you. It is listening with the
> intent to understand the other person fully, rather than listening to respond.
>
> -- [Active Listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening), Wikipedia


Active listening is not a technique but a set of practices, tricks and
principles, for example: listen to each other and let (and encourage) everyone
to speak. Don't interrupt each other. Allow and encourage asking questions,
especially open-ended ones. When replying to someone, summarize what the person
said to show that they are being heard and to make sure they were understood.

## Accountability

Let's hit up the dictionary one more time for this:

> **Accountability** (noun): Obligation or willingness to accept responsibility
> or to account for one's actions.

Accountability is more about people taking responsibility rather than having
scapegoats for everything. Quite paradoxically, accountability norms are about
making _accounting_ unnecessary. If people feel responsible for their fate,
they _act_ consequently and accounting is not needed. 

A first impression some people have regarding safety and accountability is that
there might be some trade-off. That pursuing accountability might be
detrimental to safety, or vice versa. The best approach is to aim for both high
safety and accountability[^safe-ted] [^team-ted]. Maximizing only one of
them can be as unproductive as having neither:
 
![Safety/Accountability quadrants](/images/quadrant.png){: .align-center}

Accountability norms usually revolve around the following topics:

{: .big-bullets}
1. _Overcommunicate._
2. _Be data and fact driven, result oriented._
3. _Capitalize on uniqueness and strengths of people._
4. _Yield control to the team._
5. _Instill purpose._

**(1) Overcommunicating** is about sharing the vision, priorities and strategy.
Share success, rationalize failure with your team. Be honest and strive for
balance. Research also shows that people not only need what to do but also why
they are doing things. That is, not only SMART objectives, but also a “stretch
objective” that makes sense altogether and reinforces purpose (see
[Purpose](#purpose) below). 

**(2) Being data and result driven** will remove politics and arbitrary discriminations.

When it comes to **(3) capitalizing on uniqueness**, from my experience, we
often set milestones and performance goals for our teams modelled mostly after
our own abilities, preferences, and biases. That is a receipt for failure and
will increase your workload as a manager. Rather than seeing your team as a
uniform labor force, let them do what they do best and help them with the
things they don't do well yet. For that, it's crucial to have a diverse team
bringing in different skill sets, unless what you do doesn't require any
creativity or it is very narrow in scope. 

Empowering your team and **(4) giving them the control** will increase their
motivation and will reverse the power dynamics, accountability won't be needed.
However, most people are not prepared or willing to accept control. You have to
create "_opportunities to make choices so that people get the sense of autonomy
and self-determination_" [^smarter-faster-better]. When chores are presented as
choices rather than as commands, researchers have found that people are more
motivated to complete difficult tasks. This is something people with kids know
well: "do you want to wear today your red or your blue scarf?" will work better
than "put on the scarf!". Similarly, when tasks are presented as a "learning
exercise", rather than an activity which can succeed or fail[^freeman-comment],
people are more likely to engage and perform. Another interesting concept
explained in the literature is "bias towards action" [^smarter-faster-better]:
by letting people _act_, even if they make many mistakes in the beginning, will
create a safer environment and turn people into responsible individuals.

### Purpose

Purpose allows us to answer why we do things, and knowing "why", in general,
motivates people.  Purpose is sometimes overlooked with excuses like "work is
just work", "people should be self-motivated and proactive" or "there's no way
I can bring purpose to evil-product-company-or-field". Purpose is usually
considered a _tool_ of accountability. The presentation upon which this post is
based had an entire top-level section dedicated to this topic, highlighting its
importance. This post didn't want to be any less. 

From my experience purpose norms can be related to:

{: .big-bullets}
1. _Make things real, down to earth._
2. _Have "moonshots", "stretch" goals._
3. _Give agency._
4. _Making a difference, feeling helpful._
5. _Learning._

While we can develop a big deal of our trade without talking to users, I've
observed how some people derive satisfaction seeing their work being used by
others, even if the feedback from users or customers wasn't always positive.
This is an example of how **(1) making things real, down to earth** can create
purpose. 

**(2) Moonshots**, named after the famous President Kennedy's goal of reaching
the moon in a decade, is Google's name for goals with extreme high risk and
extreme high impact. **(2) [Stretch
goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting#Stretch_goals)** are perhaps
the moonshot incarnation outside Google. While SMART goals or things like OKRs
might work well from an organization  and project point of view, they can be
boring. Having a "higher order" or challenging goal can motivate people. If not
done correctly, it can backfire. 

**(3) Giving agency** is about people having a say on things (e.g. goals,
timelines, strategies, technologies, tools). 

Similar to making things down to earth, **(4) making a difference** will also
motivate people and fill their work with purpose. **(4) Feeling helpful** is also
something that most people, fundamentally, enjoy. Some companies have norms
like spending some fixed time with local charities and similar. If not done
well, this can be dangerous and can become superficial altruism. Sometimes
it's easier to be helpful to the closest ones, for example, by teaching
something to a teammate.

People have different motivations and goals in life. But one thing common to
everyone, and coded in our DNA, is that we enjoy **(5) learning** something new and
improving. It gives us that dopamine reward that we cannot live without. Some
companies allow time off for learning or have regular knowledge sessions.

# Some norms that worked well for me

I wanted to conclude with a list of some norms which have proven useful to me and
that I strive to instill in my teams, with varying degrees of success:

{: .no_toc}
### Safety

- Distribute equally conversation turn-taking.
- Praise in public, criticize in private.
- _Situational humility_[^team-ted]: perhaps not so "situational", but I admit
  often how little I know, how many mistakes I make.
- _Principle of charity_: when interpreting what other people said, I try to
  select the best possible interpretation for their statement. If there's not a
  plausible good interpretation, I ask politely if the interpretation I made is
  correct.

{: .no_toc}
### Accountability

- The person closer to a problem has to be involved in the solution[^toyota]. 
- Encourage the team to act, to have "bias towards action", as to render myself
  less necessary and avoid people being idle (which might demotivate or make
  them feel guilty about the situation).
- Regular knowledge sharing sessions and 1-1.
- Always answer requests, even if it is with "I'll answer tomorrow" or "I won't
  be able to do it because _X_". About this one, I cannot be certain it
  improves accountability, but I can say that people that regularly don't
  answer to requests, are awful to work with and accountability with them
  is very low.
